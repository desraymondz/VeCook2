# Requirements Document

## Introduction

VeCook is an AI-powered cooking assistant that serves as a "mom-like figure" to provide personalized, caring guidance throughout the cooking process. The application will be revamped from the original hackathon version (Flask + vanilla JS) to use Next.js with the app router, while maintaining and enhancing the core features: personalized meal planning, hands-free recipe navigation, AI-powered assistance, and content creation capabilities.
